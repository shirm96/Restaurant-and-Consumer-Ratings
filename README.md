# Restaurant and-Consumer Ratings -  Project
## About The Project:
In this project, I've taken a big database about customer rating of 130 different restaurants in Mexico.
The questions I've asked in this project were about the customer demography, and the restaurant different services they offer and their effect on the restaurant rating.

## The Database:
The dataset contains 5 tables, about restaurants in Mexico and about customers who rated them. In the dataset we have 130 restaurants rated and 138 people responded to the questionnaire. The database was taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/restaurant-data-with-consumer-ratings?select=geoplaces2.csv/).
## The Technology:
The database was analyzed using SQL ms server, and afterward was visualized using tableau public.
## Tableau Usage:
Iv'e used Tableau public in order to make visualization for the results and a dashborad.

Here is the [Dashborad](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/shir.meir/viz/RestaurantsRating-Project/RestaurantsRating/).
